            <h2 class='h'>Weather Over Time</h2>
            <p class='p'>
                This time series shows the historical weather trends associated with the selected city and month.<br>
                the lower line represents the daily minimums, the middle the average, and uppermost the daily maximum. <br>
                This chart was designed using plotly's time series functionality associated with line charts. <br> 
                Our data comes from a dataset that records the hourly weather statistics from 2012 to 2017. <br>
                We aggregated the daily values into daily averages while preservering the minimal and max values for a given day. <br>

            <h2 class='h'>Qualitative Weather Donut</h2>
            <p class='p'>
                Included in our <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/selfishgene/historical-hourly-weather-data">dataset</a> are qualitative <br>
                descriptions of daily weather conditions for each city. The donut chart displays these values for the selected month. <br>
                Coloring for each slice is dynamically generated so that like values e.g "light rain" or "heavy rain" have a similar color scheme <br>
                yet differ in hue to distinguish them.

            <h2 class='h'>Airport Delays Scatter Chart</h2>
            <p class='p'>
                We were also able to access data on <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays'>airport delays</a>. We indexed the data against the cities we have <br>
                and have displayed in this scatter chart the unique effects weather has on the frequency of flight delays <strong>per city and month of the year</strong> users <br>
                can use this information to anticipate how troublesome their flights could potentially be on say during a "snowstorm in Boston" vs. one in New York.
