                This time series shows the historical weather trends associated with the selected city and month.
                the lower line represents the daily minimums, the middle the average, and uppermost the daily maximum. 
                This chart was designed using plotly's time series functionality associated with line charts.  
                Our data comes from a dataset that records the hourly weather statistics from 2012 to 2017. 
                We aggregated the daily values into daily averages while preservering the minimal and max values for a given day.

            <p class='p'>
                Included in our <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/selfishgene/historical-hourly-weather-data">dataset</a> are qualitative 
                descriptions of daily weather conditions for each city. The donut chart displays these values for the selected month. 
                Coloring for each slice is dynamically generated so that like values e.g "light rain" or "heavy rain" have a similar color scheme 
                yet differ in hue to distinguish them.

                We were also able to access data on <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays'>airport delays</a>. We indexed the data against the cities we have
                and have displayed in this scatter chart the unique effects weather has on the frequency of flight delays <strong>per city and month of the year</strong> users
                can use this information to anticipate how troublesome their flights could potentially be on say during a "snowstorm in Boston" vs. one in New York.
